2. **Attach Your PDF**  
   Once you’ve opened the channel, send a message by attaching the PDF containing the terms and conditions. Make sure the file is complete and readable.

3. **Specify the Language**  
   In the same message, mention the language you prefer for the bullet points, such as English, Bengali, or Hindi. If the language is recognizable, you’ll receive responses in your preferred language and in English.

4. **Receive Key Points**  
   You’ll receive two messages:
   - The first will contain the key points of the terms and conditions in English.  
   - The second will include the same key points translated into your preferred language.  

And that’s it! No more struggling with dense legal jargon—just the essential information you need, delivered in a format that’s clear and easy to understand.
